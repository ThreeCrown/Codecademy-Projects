                            Hello! My name is Stephan Adams. I am a self taught developer from Texas with a very diverse work history. I have been fortunate enough to have a wide range of exposure to the buisness and
                            customer facing side of the IT industry for over a decade. Having been raised in the infancy of the age of technology has afforded me the unique perspective of people and their relationship
                            with and without technology. I have found meaning in my life by building and delivering technologies for people to enjoy catered to varying niche communities that is both engaging and

                            Being the founder of my own company, Otter Lodge Studios, and the Chairman of a non-profit community of over 500+ members have been some led me to an attitude centered around large scale 
                            content consumption and creation, as well as solution based excecutions. With Otter Lodge Studios, we have been pushing to bring the perfect content publisher for avid fantasy fans to the 
                            Web3 industry. While managing my community, I have had time to develop solutions for not only my community, but others like mine.

                            In my free time I spend my time listening to books while I code software I feel could be useful to me or multiple people. If I am being productive that is. Otherwise you will see me
                            spending time exploring nature with my family or playing video games with my son or friends.
